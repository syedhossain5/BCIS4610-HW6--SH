GitHub seems really simple to use. I understand why Microsoft bought it. I piceked the General Public Licesnse (GNU) because I felt that it best suited GitHub and its core values. Also, whatever software I create, I would want it to be open sourced. I rather license it to be free than someone else not use it because they can't do their edits to make it better, to make it custom to fit their needs.
